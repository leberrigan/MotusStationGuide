        <p>Attached to the top of the mast. The antenna boom attaches to the mast
          with an antenna mounting bracket, and the antenna elements attach to the
          boom. There are usually 9 elements attached to the boom with one element
          that has a coaxial cable coming out of it.</p>
        <p><b>What to look for:</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Bent elements will affect the signal reception, but usually not that badly
            unless severely bent (~30 degrees). The most important element is the one
            that has the coaxial cable. Just take photos of anything bent.</li>
          <li>Loose elements. If they are not all horizontally aligned, they might be
            loose. Try tightening to bolts.</li>
          <li>If the antenna directions are wrong, the boom might not be attached to
            the mast tight enough. Try rotating the antenna by hand and if it&#x2019;s
            easy, tighten the u-bolts on the antenna mounting bracket. Add bicycle
            inner tubes if necessary.</li>

Note BeagleBone computers only has 1 USB port so it must use a USB Hub to expand the number of available ports. Raspberry Pi computers have 4 ports so they _do not_ require a USB hub.
