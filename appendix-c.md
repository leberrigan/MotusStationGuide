|                                  | [mast]{.ul}. The [antenna        |
|                                  | boom]{.ul} attaches to the       |
|                                  | [mast]{.ul} with an [antenna     |
|                                  | mounting bracket]{.ul}, and the  |
|                                  | [antenna elements]{.ul} attach   |
|                                  | to the boom. There are usually 9 |
|                                  | elements attached to the boom    |
|                                  | with one [element]{.ul} that has |
|                                  | a [coaxial cable]{.ul} coming    |
|                                  | out of it.                       |

|                                  |     affect the signal reception, |
|                                  |     but usually not that badly   |
|                                  |     unless severely bent (\~30   |
|                                  |     degrees). The most important |
|                                  |     element is the one that has  |
|                                  |     the coaxial cable. Just take |
|                                  |     photos of anything bent.     |

|                                  |     they are not all             |
|                                  |     horizontally aligned, they   |
|                                  |     might be loose. Try          |
|                                  |     tightening to bolts.         |

|                                  | -   If the [antenna              |
|                                  |     directions]{.ul} are wrong,  |
|                                  |     the boom might not be        |
|                                  |     attached to the mast tight   |
|                                  |     enough. Try rotating the     |
|                                  |     antenna by hand and if it's  |
|                                  |     easy, tighten the u-bolts on |
|                                  |     the antenna mounting         |
|                                  |     bracket. Add bicycle inner   |
|                                  |     tubes if necessary.          |
