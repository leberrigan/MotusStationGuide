  **Collaborators**                Any person who uses Motus for research, education, or otherwise
  **Receiver**                     A computer designed to receive radio signals
  **Receiver deployment**          Describes a single setup of a receiver station. This includes information such as: number, types, directions, and heights of antennas; location of station, receiver listening frequency, computer serial numbers, type of antenna mounting structure. Deployments are registered on Motus.org.
  **Coax**                         Coaxial cable, typically used to connect antennas to receivers.
  **CTT^TM^**                      Cellular Tracking Technologies^TM^
  **Antenna mount**                The part which connects the antenna to the mounting structure. Typically a metal plate with U-bolts.
  **Antenna mounting structure**   Usually a mast, but can be anything imaginable, such as a guard rail, a tree, or a wall.
  **Mast**                         A structure used to mount antennas. Typically a metal pipe and often telescopic (pop-up), such as the [20A and 50A](http://wadeantenna.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SPEC0047_C01_POP-UP-MAST_MCN0115.pdf) masts.
  **Tripod**                       A three-legged structure used to support a mast. Usually 10-feet (3 m) tall (TRM-10L).
  **Angle iron**                   Can be steel or aluminum. Angled piece of metal typically used to affix solar panels to tripods.
  **Mast collar**                  A ring around the mast typically used to affix guy lines.
  **DMX**                          A triangular tower structure used for more permanent installations. Usually requires a concrete footing or a building for support.
  **Non-penetrating Roof Mount**   A type of mast mount which does not require anchoring. Typically used on flat roofs. See non-penetrating roof mounts.
  **SensorGnome**                  Open source receiver developed at the Phil Taylor Lab, Acadia University.
  **CTT SensorStation^TM^**        Receiver made by Cellular Tracking Technologies
  **Lotek SRX**                    SRX-series receiver made by Lotek Wireless Ltd.
  **Tag**                          A radio transmitter made by Lotek or Cellular Tracking Technologies^TM^.
  **Motus Network**                A collaborative network of receivers, transmitters, partners, and researchers which use radio telemetry to study animal movement.
