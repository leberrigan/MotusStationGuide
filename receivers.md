# Receivers

The Motus Network mostly consists of stationary automated radio
telemetry stations which continuously record incoming radio pulses.
Mobile stations also exist, either affixed to a moving vehicle, boat, or
in a backpack on foot. Other receivers are used for manual tracking so
that wildlife can be located in and observed in-person for more precise
location data.

## Automated Telemetry Receivers

There are three types of receivers compatible with Motus that can be
purchased, or built yourself in some cases: Lotek Wireles Inc (SRX600,
800 and D-series receivers), CTT Sensorstation and Nodes, and the
open-source SensorGnome.

Sensorgnomes can be purchased from
[[Compudata]{.ul}](https://compudata.ca/sensorgnome/) or [[RFS
Scientific]{.ul}](https://www.rfsscientific.com/) or built with the
[[following
instructions]{.ul}](https://archived.sensorgnome.org/How_do_I_build_a_SensorGnome/).
Note these instructions are very outdated and require revision. New
instructions will be posted in the near future.

^1^ Price does not include cost of: Wi-Fi module; cellular module; data
plans; case; power supply; bulkheads (1 required per antenna); or
testing time.

^2^ CTT charges \$5/month base plus data costs for cellular data plans
and an additional \$5/month for station health reports. Contact CTT for
more details.

^3^ Cost for self-built SensorGnomes is estimated to be \~\$150 USD
without dongles, but prices may vary. Instructions on building
SensorGnomes can be found
[[here]{.ul}](https://archived.sensorgnome.org/How_do_I_build_a_SensorGnome/),
but note these are very outdated and require revision. New instructions
will be posted in the near future. We do not recomend collaborators
build their own SensorGnome without prior experience.

## Manual Telemetry Receivers

For manual telemetry, we need a portable receiver that can decode tag
IDs in real time.
