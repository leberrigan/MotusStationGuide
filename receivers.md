# Receivers

The Motus Network mostly consists of stationary automated radio
telemetry stations which continuously record incoming radio pulses.
Mobile stations also exist, either affixed to a moving vehicle, boat, or
in a backpack on foot. Other receivers are used for manual tracking so
that wildlife can be located in and observed in-person for more precise
location data.

## Automated Telemetry Receivers

There are three types of receivers compatible with Motus that can be
purchased, or built yourself in some cases: Lotek Wireles Inc (SRX600,
800 and D-series receivers), CTT Sensorstation and Nodes, and the
open-source SensorGnome.

Sensorgnomes can be purchased from
[<u>Compudata</u>](https://compudata.ca/sensorgnome/) or [<u>RFS
Scientific</u>](https://www.rfsscientific.com/) or built with the
[<u>following
instructions</u>](https://archived.sensorgnome.org/How_do_I_build_a_SensorGnome/).
Note these instructions are very outdated and require revision. New
instructions will be posted in the near future.

<sup>1</sup> Price does not include cost of: Wi-Fi module; cellular
module; data plans; case; power supply; bulkheads (1 required per
antenna); or testing time.

<sup>2</sup> CTT charges $5/month base plus data costs for cellular data
plans and an additional $5/month for station health reports. Contact CTT
for more details.

<sup>3</sup> Cost for self-built SensorGnomes is estimated to be \~$150
USD without dongles, but prices may vary. Instructions on building
SensorGnomes can be found
[<u>here</u>](https://archived.sensorgnome.org/How_do_I_build_a_SensorGnome/),
but note these are very outdated and require revision. New instructions
will be posted in the near future. We do not recomend collaborators
build their own SensorGnome without prior experience.

## Manual Telemetry Receivers

For manual telemetry, we need a portable receiver that can decode tag
IDs in real time.
