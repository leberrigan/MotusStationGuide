| **Antennas** ![](<.gitbook/assets/image10 (1).png>)                                                                                                                                                       | <p><strong>Description</strong></p><p>Attached to the top of the mast. The antenna boom attaches to the mast with an antenna mounting bracket, and the antenna elements attach to the boom. There are usually 9 elements attached to the boom with one element that has a coaxial cable coming out of it.</p><p><strong>What to look for:</strong></p><ul><li>Bent elements will affect the signal reception, but usually not that badly unless severely bent (~30 degrees). The most important element is the one that has the coaxial cable. Just take photos of anything bent.</li><li>Loose elements. If they are not all horizontally aligned, they might be loose. Try tightening to bolts.</li><li>If the antenna directions are wrong, the boom might not be attached to the mast tight enough. Try rotating the antenna by hand and if it’s easy, tighten the u-bolts on the antenna mounting bracket. Add bicycle inner tubes if necessary.</li></ul> |

**USB Port Numbering for Raspberry Pi or BeagleBone computers.**

Note BeagleBone computers only has 1 USB port so it must use a USB Hub to expand the number of available ports. Raspberry Pi computers have 4 ports so they _do not_ require a USB hub.
